### Public Health Scotland Rshiny Dashboard

##### This was a group project which involved me and other three team mates. The project question was: "To what extent is the NHS winter crises real? How has winter impacted NHS Scotland in the past? Why might the situation be even more critical in the coming year and how can the pandemic influence the potential scenario?" 

##### The interactive dashboard has been developed in RShiny and examines the questions outlined above with other sub questions regarding demographics and how these drive hospital activity.
